This reei ot microfiim contains materiai
which rias paper color changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear ori
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that eti text and illustrations ere
iegibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text end illustrations exist
in a sinqie image or when materiei
bacquounds differ, such trames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects tite cernere
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
ot trie text; the second exposure reflects the

cernere operator’s best ettort to capture
iliustretive materiai or the remaining text. it

is hoped that titis practice witi resuit in a
microfiim product that tuiiy serves tite needs

ot most researchers.
